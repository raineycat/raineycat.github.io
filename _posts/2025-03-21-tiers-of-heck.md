## My editor for SpiderHeck tiers of heck codes now lives at [reddust.uk/tiers-web](https://reddust.uk/tiers-web)!
The source code is also available at: [raineycat/tiers-web](https://github.com/raineycat/tiers-web)

You can use it to insppect, edit and create level codes, as well as pushing the game beyond its normal limits.
> Levels created with the tool are 'watermarked', so people will be able to tell if they were legitimately created or not!
