## Hello, world and welcome!

I've decided to fix this pages site up and use it as a place to put:
- Small things I've looked into while on a tangent
- Funny things I encounter looking through code
- Longer investigations/dives into cool sofware (and/or hardware!)

> Warning:
> Posts here may be either very infrequent, so don't anticipate any kind of scheduling
> 
> Also, bear in mind I'm not particularly *good* at the things I like doing, so you shouldn't expect be amazed at my skills
> 
> Final warning I promise: posts here may contain lethal levels of `:3`, silliness and frustrated typos!
