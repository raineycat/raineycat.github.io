This is a small game I wrote over a few days where you have to go through each element in the periodic table and remember the name from the symbol.

You can play it at the above link, or view the source code (JS+HTML+CSS) at [raineycat/element-game](https://github.com/raineycat/element-game)!

> The game was only written with myself and a few players in mind, so it may be a little buggy.
> It may be updated in the future, though this isn't certain. :3
